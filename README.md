# electronic-sales-dashboard
Interactive sales dashboard project built with Power BI using simulated electronic retail data. Provides monthly and yearly performance analysis through MoM and YoY metrics, key business KPIs, and structured data modeling with DAX time intelligence.

**Findings:**
Overall, business performance shows positive but still limited growth. The number of customers has increased, but this has not yet been followed by higher average transaction value per customer. Annual growth (YoY) was mainly driven by strong performance at the beginning of the year, while performance in subsequent periods remained unstable, as reflected in the fluctuating MoM pattern.
The market structure remains relatively stable, with the Private segment as the main contributor, although there are signs of declining contributions from high-value customers and shifts in product preferences. In addition, there is a shift in sales channels from Online (2024) to Offline (2025), indicating that direct interaction still plays an important role in driving purchasing decisions for high-value electronic products.
The seasonal pattern of sales suggests the need for strategies focused on increasing customer value, stabilizing demand, and optimizing sales channels in an integrated manner.
